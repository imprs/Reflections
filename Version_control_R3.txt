Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A.  When I want to push my project to github to share and collabrate with others.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A.  Because other contributors to the repository might working on to add some feature and one don't want those changes untill it finishes.

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A.  "Branch: When more than one commit has the same parent" versus "forks: Here one will copy/clone someone's repo on github itself and modify it for his/her own purpose" versus "Clone: It can be local to local for different locations or remote to local and in both cases it will be copied as it is"
    Clone: when want to use someone else's repo on my local machine
	Branch: while working on experimental feature, I would create new branch.
	forks: When I want to modify repo made by other user and at the same time I want to publish this updated repo on my GiHub page.
	
Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A.  It will give me an idea about when I pushed/pulled my changes to GitHub for last.
