Version Control



1. How did viewing diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?

A. Instead of showing all the lines it show me only those lines which was changed in new file compared to old file.



2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A. So, at any time I can see that what changes I have made till date and how they are affecting my output.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A. By doing it manually you will do it for "one logical reason", while on the other hand in google docs it will make it as a newer version irrespective of any logical reason but with mo=inor changes including typos.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A. So, at any point of time if one wants over all project he can use it or if you are working collabratively and one wants previous version of a complete project he/she can use it.
